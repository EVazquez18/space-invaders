# space-invaders

A Space Invaders game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was done to expand on my game development skills, to practice coding, and to understand the application of the languages to game development.

This game was built from a tutorial by Max Wihlborg. The two-part video series is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IerQ5M9p4YY and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhkNzg6FPo
